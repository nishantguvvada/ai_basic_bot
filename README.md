# Basic Bot

Basic Bot is a sample to showcase integration of AI, specifically LLMs, with websites or in this case, a React application.

# Technical Details

The frontend built using React takes in the input from the user, formats the message into a format acceptable by the AI API and appends it to the list of messages before sending it to the AI model.

## To-do:

- Create a text input to allow users to paste the API key
- Create a drop down element to allow users to select the model
